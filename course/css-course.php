            <h3>Course overview</h3>
            <p>Ever wonder how the latest website designs are made? Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the main coding files used to lay out a website and its design. CSS3 is the latest in styling standards, and it brings several new properties and declarations you can use to make your website design more easily created. CSS is currently the only standard in website design that plugs directly into your HTML, even the latest HTML5 standards. With CSS3 and HTML5, you can create the latest interactive pages for your website viewers. 
                <br><br>
                This course shows you how to design web pages and create CSS classes from a beginner's level to a more intermediate level. It starts off with basic HTML declarations, properties, values and how to include a CSS style sheet with your HTML code. For those of you who are new to CSS and HTML, we show you step-by-step how to create a CSS file and include it in your HTML code, even if you use a cloud server for your hosting.
                <br><br>
                We show you how to position your elements, lay out your elements relative to your documents, and style your HTML using predefined CSS values. We introduce you to the common CSS styling that you'll need when you start off designing your pages. If you want to get to know CSS and website design, this course is meant for you, and it can be used by anyone who hasn't even seen one line of CSS code yet. We focus on the latest CSS 3 and HTML5 standards, so you get the latest when coding your website pages instead of focusing on older code.</p>
